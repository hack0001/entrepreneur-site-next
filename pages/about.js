							<p>
								The idea of wealth can vary from person to person with the most
								common being centered around the acquisition of material items -
								the luxury apartment, the expensive sports car and the
								'influencer' lifestyle.
							</p>
							<p>
								While this can be incidental it is not a result of&nbsp;
								<strong>REAL</strong> wealth.
							</p>
							<p>
								Google broadly defines wealth as "a plentiful supply of a
								particular desirable thing" but this can encompass a number of
								different objectives such as time, good health and the ability
								to make a difference in other people's lives.
							</p>
							<p>
								We believe <strong>REAL</strong> wealth and success to be a
								lifelong endeavour where you continually set new goals and
								targets to improve your life and those around you. It is the
								process of building a legacy that provides a sense of
								accomplishment that can never be taken away from you.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is something that has to be built from humble beginnings and
								has the potential to change other people's lives as well as
								yours.
							</p>

										A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to
										bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do.”
